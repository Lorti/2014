When a friend needed a weapon for his first-person adventure prototype I created Níniel. At first I simply wanted to sculpt an elven bow in my spare time, but then I decided to create a polished game model that may benefit other developers as well. Therefore it is now available for free on the Unity Asset Store with optional animations for $&thinsp;5.
