When a friend needed a weapon for his first-person adventure prototype I created a rough version of Níniel. At first I just wanted to sculpt an elven bow with carvings in my spare time, but then I decided to create a real game model that may benefit other developers as well. It is now available for free on the Unity Asset Store.
