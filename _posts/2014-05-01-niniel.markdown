When a friend needed a weapon for his first-person adventure prototype I created Níniel. At first I simply wanted to sculpt an elven bow in my spare time, but then I decided to create a polished game model that may benefit other developers as well. Therefore it is now available for free on the Unity Asset Store. The rig and animations can be obtained as well, but for a small price.
