Clementine is a skill-based brain-twisting platformer developed by [Radiated Pixel](1). Its prototype was created at a game jam on a single weekend. Since then it has turned into our first commercially available game for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. I created the website, environment graphics and sound effects. To lessen the burden on our main programmer I also took over minor parts of the code prior to the release.
